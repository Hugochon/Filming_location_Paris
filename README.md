# Quick project around the films recorded in Paris

This project is part of my Advanced Web Development course. 

The goal of this work was to use the API of Paris Data (https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/lieux-de-tournage-a-paris/api/), to create a website that displays the filming location of different films. The website has a search bar in order to search for the film we want, then it calls the API to locate all the different spots and pins them on the map of Paris.

You can access the site from this link : https://tournage-film-paris.vercel.app/
